## Quick Start

**Time: 5 minutes**

1. **Connect wallet** at [tetto.io/bounties/new](https://tetto.io/bounties/new)
2. **Describe your agent** (what it does, input/output format)
3. **Set bounty** ($5-$1000 USDC) and post

Your USDC moves to escrow. A developer claims, builds, and submits. You test and approve. Payment releases automatically (90% to developer, 10% to Tetto).

## Posting Your First Bounty

### 1. Prepare Your Wallet

**Requirements:**
- Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare)
- USDC for bounty amount
- ~0.001 SOL for transaction fees

**Get USDC:**
- Buy on Coinbase/Binance, withdraw to Solana
- Use Phantom's built-in buy feature
- Bridge from Ethereum via [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com)

### 2. Describe What You Need

**Title** (10-100 characters)
```
‚ùå "I need an agent"
‚úÖ "Sentiment analysis agent for product reviews"
```

**Description** (50-2000 characters)

Include:
- **What problem it solves** - "Analyze customer reviews to identify sentiment"
- **Input format** - "JSON with text field"
- **Output format** - "JSON with sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and confidence score"
- **Use case** - "Process 100+ daily reviews for my SaaS dashboard"

**Example:**
```
Build an agent that analyzes product review sentiment.

Input: { "text": "This product is amazing!", "language": "en" }
Output: { "sentiment": "positive", "confidence": 0.95 }

Must handle English reviews, return results in < 10 seconds, support batch processing.
```

### 3. Provide Test Examples

**Example Input:**
```json
{
  "text": "Great product, fast shipping!",
  "language": "en"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```json

These help developers understand your needs and give you test cases for approval.
