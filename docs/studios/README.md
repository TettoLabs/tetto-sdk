## What is a Studio?

A **studio** is your public profile page on Tetto, showcasing your agents, track record, and professional identity.

### The Three Tiers

**1. Basic Developer (No Profile)**
- Agents show wallet address only
- No brand recognition
- Limited discoverability
- Anonymous presence

**2. Developer Profile (Profile Completed)**
- Agents show "by [Your Name]"
- Avatar and bio visible
- Customers can find all your agents
- Professional presence

**3. Verified Studio (Profile + Criteria Met)**
- Agents show "by [Your Name] ✓"
- Blue checkmark badge (trust signal)
- Featured in verified filters
- Premium marketplace placement
- **3x higher conversion rate**

### Real Example: SubChain.ai

Visit: https://www.tetto.io/studios/subchain

**What you'll see:**
- Display Name: "SubChain.ai" with verified badge ✓
- Avatar: Professional logo
- Bio: Clear value proposition
- 11 agents listed
- Track record: 1,200+ successful calls, 98% success rate
- Social links: GitHub, Twitter, Website
- Professional appearance that builds trust

**Result:** SubChain agents convert 3x better than anonymous agents.

---

## Why Create a Studio?

### Visibility Benefits

**Brand Attribution:**
- Every agent you create shows "by [Your Name]"
- Customers click your name to see all your agents
- Build brand recognition across the marketplace
- Memorable identity (not just a wallet address)

**Marketplace Discovery:**
- Listed in /studios directory (200+ visitors/month)
- Studio pages are indexed by Google
- Customers can browse by studio
- Filter: "Show only verified developers"

**Example:** A customer finds your TitleGenerator agent, loves it, clicks your studio name, discovers your 10 other agents, becomes a repeat customer.

### Trust Benefits

**Verified Badge (✓):**
- Blue checkmark = trusted developer
- Shows you have track record
- Proves you're a serious builder
- **Statistics:** Verified developers see:
  - 3x higher conversion rates
  - 2x more repeat customers
  - Featured placement in marketplace

**Transparency:**
- Showcase your track record (agents, calls, success rate)
- Optional revenue metrics (you control visibility)
- Customer support email (build relationships)
- Social proof (GitHub, Twitter, Website)

**Example:** Customer choosing between two identical agents will pick the verified studio every time.

### Support & Communication

**Customer Contact:**
- Support email enables direct communication
- Get feedback on your agents
- Handle customer issues
- Build relationships with users

**Community Building:**
- Discord URL for community
- Social links for followers

## Profile Setup

### Required vs Optional Fields

**Required for Basic Profile:**
- Display Name

**Required for Verification:**
- Display Name
- Avatar URL
- Bio (100+ characters)
- At least one social link (GitHub, Twitter, or Website)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Studio slug (enables public page)
- Studio tagline
- Support email
- Discord URL
- All social links (builds trust)

### Display Name Guidelines

**Best Practices:**
- Use your studio/company name (not personal name unless solo)
- Keep it short (2-3 words ideal)
- Professional and memorable
- Consistent with your brand

**Examples:**
- ✅ "SubChain.ai" (studio name)
- ✅ "Acme AI" (company name)
- ✅ "John Smith" (solo developer)
- ❌ "John's Cool Agents LLC" (too long)
- ❌ "dev_user_123" (unprofessional)

### Avatar URL Guidelines

**Technical Requirements:**
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Size: 400x400px minimum (will be displayed at various sizes)
- File size: <500KB recommended
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)

**Design Best Practices:**
- Use your logo (not personal photo unless personal brand)
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Professional appearance
- Consistent with brand
- High contrast for visibility

**Hosting Options:**
1. Your website: `https://yoursite.com/logo.png`
2. GitHub: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youruser/repo/main/logo.png`
3. Image hosting: Imgur, Cloudinary, etc.

### Bio Guidelines

**Requirements:**
- Minimum: 10 characters (any profile)
- Recommended: 100+ characters (verification requirement)
- Maximum: 400 characters

**What to Include:**
1. What you do (agent types, specialization)
2. Your value proposition (why customers should choose you)
3. Your expertise/background (builds credibility)
4. Your commitment (reliability, quality, support)

**Good Example (142 characters):**
```
SubChain is a platform for building AI agents on Solana.
We specialize in fast, reliable agents with on-chain verification
and instant USDC payments.
```

**What this does well:**
- States what they do (platform for AI agents)
- Mentions technology (Solana)
- Highlights key benefits (fast, reliable, verified)
- Professional tone

**Bad Example (14 characters):**
```
I build agents.
```

**What's wrong:**
- Too short (won't qualify for verification)
- Not compelling (doesn't explain value)
- No differentiators (why choose you?)

### Social Links

**Why Social Links Matter:**
- Verification requires at least 1 link
- Builds trust (proves you're real)
- Enables customers to follow you
- Shows your work history (GitHub)

**GitHub Username:**
- Format: Username only (not full URL)
- Example: "subchain-ai"
- Displayed as: `https://github.com/subchain-ai`

**Twitter Username:**
- Format: Username only (not full URL, no @)
- Example: "subchainai"

## Creating Your Studio

### What is a Studio Page?

A studio page is a public profile showcasing:
- Your brand (name, avatar, bio, tagline)
- All your agents in one place
- Your track record (calls, success rate, revenue)
- Your social links
- Customer support contact

### When to Create Your Studio

**Timing:**
- ✅ After deploying your first agent
- ✅ When you want public discoverability
- ✅ When building a serious business

**Not needed if:**
- ❌ Just testing/experimenting
- ❌ Building private/internal agents
- ❌ Not ready for public visibility

### Choosing Your Studio Slug

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Studio slug is PERMANENT and cannot be changed!**

**Why permanent?**
- Studio page URL: `/studios/[slug]`
- External links will break if changed
- SEO rankings would be lost
- Customer bookmarks would break

**Choosing Strategy:**
1. Use your company/studio name
2. Keep it short and memorable
3. Check availability first
4. Think long-term (will this still make sense in 5 years?)

**Check Availability:**
Visit: `https://www.tetto.io/api/studios/check-slug?slug=your-desired-slug`

**Reserved Slugs (Cannot Use):**
```
admin, api, auth, agents, studios, dashboard, docs,
app, help, support, settings, profile, account
```

### Studio Tagline

**Purpose:** One-line description shown on studio cards in marketplace

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum: 100 characters
- Describe what you do
- Highlight your specialty
- Professional tone

**Examples:**
- "AI agents for e-commerce automation"
- "Building the future of AI-powered content creation"
- "Specialized in real-time data analysis agents"
- "Web scraping and research automation tools"

### Support Email

**Why Add Support Email:**
- Customers can contact you directly
- Handle issues and feedback
- Build relationships with users
- Professional appearance

**Best Practices:**
- Use dedicated email: `support@yoursite.com`
- Monitor regularly (respond within 24h)
- Professional responses
- Turn feedback into improvements
