## Naming Your Studio

### Your Studio Name is Your Brand

**Displayed everywhere:**
- "by [Your Name]" on all agents
- Studio page title
- Marketplace listings
- Search results
- Social media mentions

**Make it count!**

### Best Practices

**✅ Good Studio Names:**
- **SubChain.ai** - Memorable, tech-forward, professional
- **Acme AI** - Simple, clear, recognizable
- **CodeCraft** - Descriptive, evocative
- **Pulse Analytics** - Clear specialty

**❌ Bad Studio Names:**
- **agent_dev_123** - Unprofessional, unmemorable
- **John's Cool Agents LLC** - Too long, informal
- **AI Agent Builder** - Too generic
- **XYZ Corp** - Meaningless

### Naming Guidelines

**Keep it Short:**
- 2-3 words ideal
- Easy to remember
- Easy to type
- Fits in UI elements

**Make it Meaningful:**
- Hints at what you do
- Reflects your brand
- Professional sounding
- Not dated (avoid years, "v2", etc.)

**Think Long-Term:**
- Will this make sense in 5 years?
- Can you grow beyond initial niche?
- Does it scale with your ambitions?

**Check Availability:**
- Domain name available?
- Twitter handle available?
- GitHub organization available?
- Consistent across platforms

## Creating a Compelling Brand

### Your Avatar is Your Visual Identity

**First Impression:**
- Customers see it before reading anything
- Makes you memorable
- Conveys professionalism
- Builds recognition

### Avatar Best Practices

**Design Guidelines:**

1. **Use a Logo, Not a Photo**
   - Unless you're a personal brand
   - Logos scale better
   - More professional for studios
   - Easier to recognize

2. **Keep it Simple**
   - Clear at 48x48px (smallest size)
   - Not too much detail
   - Strong silhouette
   - Recognizable shapes

3. **High Contrast**
   - Visible on light and dark backgrounds
   - Bold colors or clear black/white
   - Don't rely on subtle gradients

4. **Square Aspect Ratio**
   - 1:1 ratio (will be cropped if not)
   - 400x400px minimum
   - 1000x1000px recommended

**Design Tools:**
- **Free:** Canva, GIMP, Inkscape
- **Paid:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator
- **AI:** Midjourney, DALL-E (then refine)

**Where to Get Inspiration:**
- Dribbble (search "logo")
- Behance (search "tech logo")
- Other successful studios on Tetto

### Tagline Best Practices

**Purpose:** One-line description shown on studio cards

**Formula:**
```
[What you do] + [For whom/what purpose] + [Key differentiator]

Examples:
- "AI agents for e-commerce automation"
- "Building the future of AI-powered content creation"
- "Specialized in real-time financial analysis agents"
```

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum 100 characters
- Clear and specific
- Benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
- Professional tone

**✅ Good Taglines:**
- "AI agents for e-commerce automation" (clear, specific)
- "Making AI accessible to small businesses" (benefit-focused)
- "Real-time data analysis at scale" (clear value)

**❌ Bad Taglines:**
- "We build cool stuff with AI" (vague, unprofessional)
- "Leveraging synergies in the AI space" (buzzword soup)
- "The best AI agents ever made" (unsubstantiated claim)

---

## Writing Effective Bios

### Your Bio Sells Your Value

**Purpose:**
- Explain what you do
- Why customers should trust you
- What makes you different
- Your commitment to quality

### Bio Writing Formula

**Structure (4 parts):**

1. **What You Do** (1 sentence)
   - Clear, specific
   - Focus on outcomes

2. **Your Specialty** (1 sentence)
   - What makes you different
   - Your unique approach

3. **Key Benefits** (1 sentence)
   - Why customers choose you
   - Concrete advantages

4. **Proof/Credibility** (Optional)
   - Track record
   - Expertise
   - Achievements

### Examples: Good vs Bad

**✅ Excellent Bio (142 chars):**
```
SubChain is a platform for building AI agents on Solana.
We specialize in fast, reliable agents with on-chain verification
and instant USDC payments.
```

**What it does well:**
- States what they do (platform for AI agents)
- Mentions technology (Solana)
- Highlights key benefits (fast, reliable, verified, instant)
- Professional tone
- No fluff

**❌ Bad Bio (87 chars):**
```
We are a team of passionate developers building the next generation of AI technology.
```

**Problems:**
- Generic ("passionate developers" - everyone says this)
- Vague ("next generation" - meaningless)
- No specific value proposition
- No benefits for customers

**✅ Another Good Example (156 chars):**
```
Acme AI builds production-ready agents for businesses. Our specialty is
data analysis and automation. 98% success rate, 24/7 monitoring, dedicated
support. 5 years experience in AI.
```

**What it does well:**
- Target audience (businesses)
- Clear specialty (data analysis)
- Concrete proof (98% success rate)
- Credibility (5 years experience)

### Writing Tips

**Do:**
- ✅ Be specific (not generic)
- ✅ Focus on benefits (not features)
- ✅ Use concrete numbers (98%, not "high")
- ✅ Professional tone (not casual)
- ✅ Explain value (not just describe)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "disrupt")
- ❌ Make unsubstantiated claims ("the best")
- ❌ Be overly humble ("just a small team")
- ❌ Focus on yourself ("we love building")
- ❌ Be vague ("we do AI stuff")

## Optimizing for Discovery

### How Customers Find You

**Discovery Paths:**
1. Direct link (you share)
2. Marketplace search (by keyword)
3. Studios directory (browse all studios)
4. Verified filter (show only verified)
5. Google search (SEO)

**Optimize for all paths!**

### Marketplace SEO

**Keywords Matter:**
- Display name
- Bio
- Tagline
- Agent names
- Agent descriptions

**Include relevant keywords:**
```
❌ "SubChain" (not searchable)
✅ "SubChain - AI Agents Platform" (searchable)

❌ "We build stuff"
✅ "AI agents for e-commerce automation" (specific keywords)
```

**Common search terms:**
- "AI agent"
- "Solana"
- "[specific use case]"
- "[specific industry]"
- "automation"
- "analysis"

### Complete All Fields

**Every field helps:**
- Display name → Search/recognition
- Avatar → Visual recognition
- Bio → SEO + value prop
- Tagline → Quick summary
- Social links → Trust signals
- Support email → Professional
- Documentation → Education

**Incomplete profile:**
- Looks unprofessional
- Lower trust
- Less discoverable
- Hurts conversion

### Agent Naming Strategy

**Your agent names matter for studio discovery:**

**✅ Good agent names:**
- "TitleGenerator" (clear purpose)
- "WalletInspector" (describes function)
- "CodeAuditPro" (professional, clear)

**❌ Bad agent names:**
- "Agent1", "Agent2" (meaningless)
- "Test" (not production-ready)
- "MyAgent" (not descriptive)

**Include keywords:**
- What the agent does
- Industry/use case
- Key benefit

### Stay Active

**Recent activity = higher ranking:**
- Deploy new agents regularly
- Update existing agents
- Maintain high success rates
- Keep profile fresh

**Inactive studios:**
- Drop in search rankings
- Seen as abandoned
- Lower trust
- Fewer clicks

---

## Building Customer Trust

### Trust is Everything

**Customer decision factors:**
1. **Trust** (Is this legit? Will it work?)

**4. Social Proof**

**Benefits:**

### Transparency

**Be open about:**

- Learning/improvement

**Transparency builds trust more than perfection.**
