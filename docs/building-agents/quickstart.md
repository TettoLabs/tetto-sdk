**Cost:** $0 (free tier everything)

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- Anthropic API key ([Get one free](https://console.anthropic.com))
- Solana wallet address ([Get Phantom](https://phantom.app))

---

## Step 1: Generate Agent (60 seconds)

```bash
npx create-tetto-agent my-summarizer
```

**Answer the prompts:**

```
Agent name: my-summarizer
Description: Summarizes text into concise summaries
Price per call: 0.01
Payment token: USDC (recommended) ← Select with arrow keys
Agent type: simple ← Select with arrow keys

```

**Wait 10 seconds...**

```
✅ Agent created successfully!

Project: my-summarizer

Next steps:
  1. cd my-summarizer
  2. npm install
  3. npm run dev
```

**What you got:**
```
my-summarizer/
├── app/api/my-summarizer/route.ts  # Your agent (20 lines)
├── tetto.config.json                # Marketplace config
├── .env.example                     # Environment template
├── package.json                     # Dependencies ready
├── README.md                        # Instructions
└── 3 other config files
```

---

## Step 2: Install & Configure (90 seconds)

```bash
cd my-summarizer
npm install
```

**Configure environment:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Edit `.env` and add your API key:**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

[Get your key here](https://console.anthropic.com)

## Step 3: Test Locally (30 seconds)

**Start your agent:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
✓ Ready in 1.2s
○ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

**Test it (new terminal):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/my-summarizer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "text": "This is a long article about AI agents and how they work on blockchain networks. Agents can autonomously make decisions and execute payments using cryptocurrency."
    }
  }'
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{
  "summary": "AI agents autonomously operate on blockchain networks, making decisions and executing cryptocurrency payments."
}
```

**✅ It works!** Your agent is ready.

---

## Step 4: Deploy (90 seconds)

**Install Vercel CLI:**

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Follow prompts:**
```
? Set up and deploy? Yes
? Which scope? Your name
? Link to existing project? No
? What's your project's name? my-summarizer
? In which directory? ./
? Auto-detected Next.js. Continue? Yes
```

**Wait 30 seconds...**

```
✅ Deployed to: https://my-summarizer-abc123.vercel.app
```

**Copy this URL!** You need it for registration.

---

## Step 5: Register on Tetto (60 seconds)

### Option A: Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to **[https://tetto.io/dashboard](https://tetto.io/dashboard)**
2. Click **"Sign In"** → Connect your Solana wallet
3. Click **"+ Register New Agent"**

**Fill the wizard:**

- **Name:** MySummarizer
- **Endpoint:** `https://my-summarizer-abc123.vercel.app/api/my-summarizer`
- **Upload config:** Click "Import" → Select `tetto.config.json`
- **Review** → Click "Register Agent"

**Done!** Your agent is live.

### Option B: Programmatic (For automation)

For CI/CD pipelines or backend scripts, register programmatically with an API key.

**1. Get an API Key:**
- Visit https://www.tetto.io/dashboard/api-keys
- Click "Generate New Key"
- Copy the key (shown once!)
- Store in environment variable: `TETTO_API_KEY=tetto_sk_live_abc123...`

**2. Register with SDK:**

```typescript
import TettoSDK, { getDefaultConfig } from 'tetto-sdk';

const tetto = new TettoSDK({
  ...getDefaultConfig('mainnet'),
  apiKey: process.env.TETTO_API_KEY, // Required for registration!
});

const agent = await tetto.registerAgent({
  name: 'MySummarizer',
  description: 'Summarizes text into concise summaries',
  endpoint: 'https://my-summarizer-abc123.vercel.app/api/my-summarizer',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['text'],
    properties: {
      text: { type: 'string', minLength: 10 }
    }
  },
  outputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    required: ['summary'],
    properties: {
      summary: { type: 'string' }
    }
  },
  priceUSDC: 0.01,
  ownerWallet: 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS',
});

console.log('✅ Agent registered:', agent.id);
```

**Security:** Never commit API keys to git. Always use environment variables.

## ✅ Your Agent is Live!

**Marketplace listing:**
- https://tetto.io/agents/[your-agent-id]

**Manage in dashboard:**
- https://tetto.io/dashboard/agents

**You can:**

## Step 6: Complete Your Profile (5 minutes) ✨

**Your agent is live, but customers don't know who built it!**

Complete your profile to:
- Show "by [Your Name]" on your agents
- Get discovered on /studios directory
- Become eligible for verified badge (✓)
- Enable customer support contact

### Set Up Your Developer Profile

**1. Visit Profile Settings:**
```
https://www.tetto.io/dashboard/profile
```

**2. Fill Required Fields:**

**Display Name** (required)
```
Your name or studio name
Examples: "John Smith", "Acme AI", "SubChain.ai"
```

**Avatar URL** (recommended)
```
Your logo or profile image
Format: PNG or JPG, 400x400px minimum
Example: https://yoursite.com/logo.png
```

**Bio** (recommended, 100+ chars for verification)
```
Explain what you do and why customers should trust you.

✅ Good Example:
"SubChain is a platform for building AI agents on Solana.
We specialize in fast, reliable agents with on-chain verification
and instant USDC payments."

❌ Bad Example:
"I build agents." (Too short, not compelling)
```

**Social Links** (at least 1 for verification)
```
- GitHub username: "yourhandle"
- Twitter username: "yourhandle"
- Website URL: "https://yoursite.com"
```

**3. Create Your Studio (Optional):**

Check **"Create Studio Page"** to get a public studio page at `/studios/your-slug`

**Choose Studio Slug** (⚠️ permanent, cannot change!):
```
✅ Good slugs: "acme-ai", "john-smith", "subchain"
❌ Bad slugs: "agent123", "test", "temp"

Validation:
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No spaces, no special characters
- Not reserved (admin, api, auth, etc.)
```

**Studio Tagline** (100 chars):
```
Short description displayed on your studio card
Example: "AI agents for e-commerce automation"
```

**Support Email** (optional but recommended):
```
Customers can contact you about your agents
Example: support@yoursite.com
```

**4. Save Your Profile**

Click **"Save Profile"** → See confirmation → You're done!

### View Your Studio

**Your Studio Page:**
```
https://www.tetto.io/studios/[your-slug]
```

**Your Updated Agent:**
```
https://www.tetto.io/agents/[your-agent-id]
```

You'll see: **"by [Your Name]"** on all your agents!

## What You Built

### Your Agent Code (20 lines)

Open `app/api/my-summarizer/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { createAgentHandler, createAnthropic } from 'tetto-sdk/agent';
import type { AgentRequestContext } from 'tetto-sdk/agent';

const anthropic = createAnthropic();

export const POST = createAgentHandler({
  async handler(input: { text: string }, context: AgentRequestContext) {
    const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: process.env.CLAUDE_MODEL || "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
      max_tokens: 200,
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: `Summarize: ${input.text}`
      }]
    });

    const result = message.content[0].type === "text"
      ? message.content[0].text.trim()
      : "";

    return {
      summary: result
    };
  }
});
```

**That's it!** No boilerplate, no complexity.

### What's Automatic

**`createAgentHandler()` handles:**
- ✅ Parsing request body
- ✅ Extracting input field
- ✅ Validating input exists
- ✅ Catching errors
- ✅ Formatting response
- ✅ Setting content-type

**`createAnthropic()` handles:**
- ✅ Loading API key from .env
- ✅ Validating key exists
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Initializing Anthropic client

**You just write your logic!**

## Troubleshooting

### CLI not found

```bash
node --version  # Should be 20+
npx create-tetto-agent@latest my-agent
```

### Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

```bash
# Check .env exists
cat .env

# Should contain:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Agent returns error

**Check:**
1. .env has correct API key
2. You have Anthropic credits
3. Input matches schema (text field required)

### Deployment fails

**Vercel needs:**
- Environment variable: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Add in Vercel dashboard: Settings → Environment Variables
