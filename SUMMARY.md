### **Evaluation Criteria**
As you test, evaluate:
1. **Time to First Success** - Can you get working code in 5 minutes?
2. **Documentation Clarity** - Can you find what you need quickly?
3. **Error Messages** - Are errors helpful or cryptic?
4. **Code Quality** - Are examples production-ready?
5. **Completeness** - Are there gaps or missing information?
6. **Developer Experience** - Does it feel polished?

## üó∫Ô∏è Testing Path 1: Calling Agents (Developer Integrating Tetto)

**Persona:** Frontend developer adding AI features to their app
**Time Budget:** 15 minutes
**Goal:** Call an agent successfully from a React app

### **Step 1: Read Documentation (5 min)**

**Order to read:**
1. **Start:** `README.md` (scan in 5 min)
   - Look for: Clear quickstart, professional feel, obvious next steps
   - Red flags: Confusing, too long, unclear where to start

2. **Quick Links:** Check the Quick Links section works
   - Click: "Call Agents" link
   - Should go to: `docs/calling-agents/quickstart.md`

3. **Quickstart:** `docs/calling-agents/quickstart.md`
   - Look for: Step-by-step with time estimates, working code
   - Red flags: Missing steps, unclear instructions, broken code

### **Step 2: Try the Browser Example (5 min)**

**Follow this path:**
1. Open `examples/calling-agents/browser-wallet.tsx`
   - **Evaluate:** Is it copy-paste ready? Complete? Production-quality?

2. Check the requirements section
   - **Evaluate:** Are all dependencies listed? Versions specified?

3. Look at the code structure
   - **Evaluate:** Error handling? Loading states? TypeScript types?

4. Check for hardcoded values
   - **Evaluate:** Any hardcoded agent IDs? (Should be 0)

### **Step 3: Deep Dive (5 min)**

**Read:** `docs/calling-agents/browser-guide.md`
- **Evaluate:** Comprehensive? Progressive (simple ‚Üí advanced)? Clear?

**Check:**
- Does it use dynamic agent lookup? (Should be YES everywhere)
- Are error cases handled?
- Is wallet connection explained?
- Are there production tips?

### **What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Dynamic `listAgents()` + `.find()` pattern used
- Null checks after finding agents
- Error handling in all examples
- Clear comments explaining each step
- TypeScript types properly used
- Time estimates for each section

üö© **Red Flags:**
- Hardcoded agent IDs (UUIDs in code)
- Missing error handling
- Incomplete examples (code fragments)
- Confusing instructions
- Missing prerequisites
- No time estimates

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Testing Path 2: Building Agents (Developer Creating an Agent)

**Persona:** Developer building an agent to monetize
**Time Budget:** 15 minutes
**Goal:** Understand how to build and deploy an agent

### **Step 1: Read Documentation (5 min)**

**Order to read:**
1. **Start:** `README.md` - "Option 2: Build an Agent" section
   - Look for: CLI command, manual option, clear value prop

2. **Quick Links:** Click "Build Agents" link
   - Should go to: `docs/building-agents/quickstart.md`

3. **Quickstart:** `docs/building-agents/quickstart.md`
   - Look for: CLI scaffolding steps, what you get, next steps
   - Red flags: Missing steps, unclear what happens

### **Step 2: Try the Simple Agent Example (5 min)**

**Follow this path:**
1. Open `examples/building-agents/simple-agent.ts`
   - **Evaluate:** Is it minimal? Does it show SDK utility value?

2. Check the `createAgentHandler` usage
   - **Evaluate:** Is the benefit clear? (67% less code)

3. Look at the footer documentation
   - **Evaluate:** Are deployment steps complete? Clear?

4. Check the Anthropic integration
   - **Evaluate:** Is it using SDK helpers? (`createAnthropic`)

### **Step 3: Advanced Example (5 min)**

**Read:** `examples/building-agents/coordinator-agent.ts`
- **Evaluate:** Shows advanced pattern? Economics explained? Production tips?

**Check:**
- Does coordinator use dynamic lookup for sub-agents?
- Is wallet funding explained?
- Are pricing considerations covered?
- Is the use case compelling?

### **What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- `createAgentHandler` reduces boilerplate significantly
- `createAnthropic` makes Anthropic setup trivial
- Examples show real use cases (not toy examples)
- Economics/pricing clearly explained
- Deployment steps are complete
- Error handling is automatic

üö© **Red Flags:**
- Too much boilerplate (defeats purpose of SDK utilities)
- Unclear how to deploy
- Missing environment setup
- No explanation of helper functions
- Toy examples that don't translate to production

---

## üîç Testing Path 3: Running Tests (Verify Test Experience)

**Persona:** Developer trying to run tests
**Time Budget:** 10 minutes
**Goal:** Get tests running successfully

### **Step 1: Without .env File (Test Error Messages)**

```bash
cd tetto-sdk
npm run test:integration
```

**What should happen:**
- Clear error message about missing TEST_WALLET_SECRET
- Step-by-step instructions to fix it
- Links to .env.example

**Evaluate:**
- Is the error message helpful or cryptic?
- Are the steps clear enough to follow?
- Does it tell you what to do next?

### **Step 2: Create .env and Fund Wallet (Test Setup Flow)**

**Follow the instructions from the error:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add test wallet keypair
# Fund on devnet
```

**Evaluate:**
- Is .env.example comprehensive?
- Are setup steps clear in test/README.md?
- Does it default to devnet (free)?

### **Step 3: Run Tests Successfully**

```bash
npm run test:unit        # Should pass in < 1 second
npm run test:integration # Should pass in ~15 seconds (devnet)
```

**Evaluate:**
- Do unit tests pass without ANY setup?
- Do integration tests give clear output?
- Is it obvious what's happening at each step?

### **What to Look For:**

‚úÖ **Good Signs:**
- Unit tests run instantly (no setup required)
- Integration test errors are helpful
- .env.example has comprehensive comments
- test/README.md is thorough
- Tests default to devnet (free)
- Clear separation (unit vs integration)

üö© **Red Flags:**
- Tests fail with cryptic errors
- Requires external dependencies (../tetto-portal)
- Uses mainnet by default (costs money)
- No separation of unit/integration
- Missing setup documentation

---

## üêõ Specific Things to Test

### **1. Dynamic Agent Lookup Pattern**

**Check these files should ALL use dynamic lookup:**
- `README.md` - Quickstart example
- `docs/calling-agents/quickstart.md`
- `docs/calling-agents/browser-guide.md`
- `docs/calling-agents/nodejs-guide.md`
- `docs/calling-agents/api-reference.md`
- `examples/calling-agents/browser-wallet.tsx`
- `examples/calling-agents/node-keypair.ts`
- `examples/building-agents/coordinator-agent.ts`

**Pattern should be:**
```typescript
const agents = await tetto.listAgents();
const agent = agents.find(a => a.name === 'AgentName');
if (!agent) throw new Error('Agent not found');
await tetto.callAgent(agent.id, ...);
```

**NOT:**
```typescript
await tetto.callAgent('hardcoded-uuid', ...); // ‚ùå
```

### **2. Test Error Messages**

**Try these intentionally wrong things:**
```bash
# 1. Run tests without .env
npm run test:integration
# Expected: Helpful error with 5-step fix

# 2. Invalid .env format
echo 'TEST_WALLET_SECRET=invalid' > .env
npm run test:integration
# Expected: Clear format error

# 3. Missing dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
npm run test
# Expected: Clear "run npm install" message
```

### **3. Check Documentation Navigation**

**Start at README and try to find:**
- [ ] How to call an agent from browser (should be 1-2 clicks)
- [ ] How to build a simple agent (should be 1-2 clicks)
- [ ] API reference for callAgent() (should be 2 clicks)
- [ ] How to verify a receipt (should be 2 clicks)
- [ ] Troubleshooting for "wallet not connected" (should be 2-3 clicks)

**Every search should succeed in ‚â§ 3 clicks**

### **4. Verify Example Quality**

**For each example file, check:**
- [ ] Has file header comment explaining purpose
- [ ] Lists all requirements/dependencies
- [ ] Imports are correct
- [ ] Code is complete (not fragments)
- [ ] Error handling is present
- [ ] Has usage instructions at bottom
- [ ] TypeScript types are proper
- [ ] Could actually copy-paste and use

### **5. Test Documentation Consistency**

**Version should be 0.1.0 everywhere:**
```bash
grep -r "version.*0\." . --include="*.md" --exclude-dir=node_modules
# All should say 0.1.0, none should say 0.2.0
```

**Links should all work:**
- Click every link in README.md
- Check that files actually exist
- Verify no broken references

---

## üìä Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

### **Known Limitations (Acceptable):**

1. **CI requires GitHub secrets setup**
   - Not automated in this commit
   - Requires manual: Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Add TEST_WALLET_SECRET

2. **Examples assume certain agents exist**
   - TitleGenerator, SecurityScanner, QualityAnalyzer
   - If agents are removed from marketplace, examples break
   - Mitigation: Dynamic lookup + error handling

3. **No actual wallet adapter example app**
   - Examples show components only
   - Developers need to integrate into their own app
   - Mitigation: Clear setup in browser-guide.md

### **Potential Gaps to Watch For:**

1. **Browser wallet setup might be unclear**
   - Check: Is WalletProvider setup clear in quickstart?
   - Check: Are all dependencies listed?

2. **Coordinator economics might be confusing**
   - Check: Is profit model explained?
   - Check: Is wallet funding clear?

3. **Receipt verification might be too advanced**
   - Check: Is basic usage shown first?
   - Check: Is on-chain verification optional/advanced?

4. **Test setup on Windows might differ**
   - Check: Are commands cross-platform?
   - Check: Are file paths generic?

## üî• High-Impact Areas to Test

### **1. First 60 Seconds (Critical!)**
This determines if developers bounce or stay:

**Test:**
1. Open README.md cold (pretend you've never seen it)
2. Scan for 60 seconds
3. Answer: "What is this? What can I do? Where do I start?"

**Should be obvious:**
- This is an SDK for AI agent marketplace
- You can call agents OR build agents
- Quick Links show you where to go
- Quickstart is right there

### **2. First Example Run (Make or Break)**

**Test:**
1. Try to run browser-wallet.tsx example
2. Note: What dependencies do I need? Are they listed?
3. Note: Does the code compile? Any errors?
4. Note: Is it clear what this code does?

**Should succeed:**
- All requirements listed at top
- Code compiles (TypeScript)
- Purpose is clear from comments
- Would actually work if I copy-pasted

### **3. Test Setup Experience (Common Pain Point)**

**Test:**
1. Try: `npm run test:integration` without .env
2. Read the error message
3. Try to follow the instructions

**Should feel:**
- Error is helpful (not scary)
- Instructions are actionable
- Setup is achievable (not complex)
- Documentation exists (test/README.md)
